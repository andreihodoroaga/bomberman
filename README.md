## Intro
Growing up Bomberman was one of my favorite games, and I remember playing countless hours of an online multiplayer version against my brother. (I rarely wonðŸ™‚) <br><br>

When I was assigned the task of creating a game of choice on Arduino, I knew it would be a great occasion to rebuild one of my old-school favorites.
It proved to be quite a challenge, as I was constrained by the little memory of the Arduino Uno, but nevertheless a fun one.

## Game Description
The game of Bomberman takes place on a 2D grid, where there is a set of walls that you have to destroy in order to complete the level. Different versions of the game may incorporate obstacles, power-ups, multiplayer modes, and more.
In my version, the player has to destroy all the walls in four different rooms as fast as possible, which implies finding a way to destroy as many walls at once as possible. There is a way to increase the bomb radius, but it might not be immediately obvious to the player.

## How to Play
1. Start the game from the LCD menu
2. Use the joystick to move the player (the blinking dot) around the grid
3. Place bombs by pressing the joystick
4. Destroy all walls in the four rooms as fast as possible
5. Fight for a place on the leaderboard :rocket:
